      Most agencies wonâ€™t tell you:
      Building the site is the easy part. Once you hand over your domain, youâ€™re locked in. They control your credentials, likely host your site, and are the sole people with any real understanding of how it works. From there, they trap you in their ecosystem, ensuring you stay reliant on their servicesâ€”whether you want to or not.
    ðŸ’¸
      They monetize your voice, keeping you dependent.
      Youâ€™ll be stuck on their billing cycles, with no way out. Theyâ€™ll control your siteâ€”dictating every update, every changeâ€”until you either manage to break free orâ€¦ well, until you die. And as time goes on, it only gets worse. Every year, the price creeps higher, with hidden fees, surprise charges, and new costs being added at every turn. Once youâ€™re in their ecosystem, theyâ€™ve got you.
    ðŸš€
      Revolt against the broken system.
      You deserve to own your online presence. So, weâ€™ll guide you through every step, taking care of the technical heavy lifting, while teaching you how to do it yourself. Trust us: itâ€™s not as complicated as they make it seem. Reclaim your voice, your site, and your future.
